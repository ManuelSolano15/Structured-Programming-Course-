### if-else vs switch
The expression in the statement if you decide whether the statements are executed in the block if or in the plus block. On the other hand, the expression in the modification statement decides the case to execute.

The If so, statement verifies logical expression and equality. On the other hand, modify equality checks alone.

The statement evaluates the integer, character, pointer, floating-point, or Boolean type. On the other hand, the modification statement evaluates the character or an integer data type alone.

The execution sequence is like a low statement of whether the block will be executed or the statements in another block statement will be executed. On the other hand, the statement change expression decides which case to execute, and if you do not apply a break statement after each case, it will run to the final switch of the statement.

If the expression within the outputs is false, the declaration will be executed within the block. If the statement expression changes turn out to be false, the default statements are executed.

It is difficult to edit if-else statements because it is tedious to track where a correction is needed. On the other hand, it's easy to change editing instructions because they're easy to follow.

### do-while vs while vs for
they do the same thing but there is one BIG difference from side of usability, in for cycle you do i ++ and don't care for changing argument then, but in while or do while you must change "i" in the body of cycle, but very often you forget about it and your cycle will be endless, it is uncomfortable, if you must change your "i" only by adding 1.

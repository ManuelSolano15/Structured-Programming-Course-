##### Semantic Analysis
Recognition of the coherence of the Entry.

##### Intermediate Code Generation
Transformation of the Input into an intermediate code representation for an abstract machine.

##### Code Optimization
Improvements to intermediate rendering that result in faster code to execute.

##### Code Generation
Transformation of intermediate code into object code.

##### DebuggingDebugging
Error Recognition.

## - Distinguish the levels of programming:

##### - Low-level languages
Low-level languages are those that are closest to machine language (zeros and ones). That is, they have direct control over the hardware.
Unlike high-level languages, they do not need compilers. Instead, they run directly on the processor and depend on the hardware architecture.
The programs that are created with these low-level languages are totally hardware dependent. For this reason, they cannot be migrated or used on other machines.
In addition, although they take better advantage of the characteristics of the hardware, they are the most difficult types of languages to understand and learn.

##### - medium level
Is a computer programming language such as the C language, which are among the high-level languages and the low-level languages.
They are often classified as high-level, but allow certain low-level handling. They are accurate for certain applications such as creating operating systems, as they allow abstract handling (independent of the machine, unlike the assembler), but without losing much of the power and efficiency that low-level languages have.

##### - high level
High-level languages are closer to human language and further away from the machine. Therefore, they are easier to understand and more flexible when programming.
Furthermore, this type of programming language is translated into machine language by means of an interpreter or compiler.
Likewise, being independent of the hardware, the programs written in these high-level languages can be executed on different platforms (Windows, Linux, etc.).

## - Describe the classification and characteristics of programming languages

Imperative paradigm:
Describes programming as a sequence of instructions or orders that change the state of a program. It is based on conditional orders that allow a block of determined orders to be resumed in the program if a condition is met. These first programming languages and is the paradigm on which the machine language (0 and 1) is based. Still many languages use these principles. One of its main drawbacks is the lack of flexibility due to the sequentiality of the instructions. In this paradigm, the procedural paradigm is included and is contrary to the declarative paradigm.

Functional / structured paradigm:
The programming is divided into blocks (procedures and functions) that can communicate with each other or not. Each function includes a closed procedure and could be understood as a small program in itself. Functions allow, by dividing processes into small actions, the use of code for other purposes or in other parts of a program.
Other interesting paradigms are the object-oriented paradigm, the logical paradigm, or the functional paradigm. On the other hand, another great important classification occurs between interpreted languages and compiled languages.

Interpreted languages:
The machine only understands binary language. Interpreted languages are those that by definition are not written in binary code and that require an auxiliary program (the interpreter), which translates the language so that the machine can process and execute it. Examples of this are BASIC, MADLAB, PHP, and Perl.

Compiled languages: In compiled languages, an attached program called a compiler does the transformation process to a machine-intelligible language before the end of the program. The resulting file can be executed without the need for any other intermediary program, this is what is called an executable file. Examples are C, C ++, Cobol, ADA, and Pascal.

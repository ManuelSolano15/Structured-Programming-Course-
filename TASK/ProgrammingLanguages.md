## Questions

------------
##### - Explain why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level language when writing programs?
Because high-level languages can be programmed with more common phrases or words (English) than with a low-level one like binary, which are numbers and can make longer instructions.

------------
##### - What is machine code?
It is the only language that the computer understands, it is made up of ones and zeros.

------------
##### - Give an example of a high-level language?
Java language: used to develop applications for a wide range of environments, from consumer devices to heterogeneous business systems.

------------
##### - Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages?

###### Low-level language
Binary Code: is that it is the most basic language that is part of all computer systems. It is very common because it is quite easy to use. Only two numbers are used to form the code, 1 that represents "everything" and 0 that on the contrary is "nothing".

  Machine language: Also widely used since, as its name indicates, this is going to be the code through which instructions are to be communicated to the machine. The use of this language is essential, since all the tasks to be carried out are literally sent with it.

Assembly language, something more complicated because the codes it uses are not decrypted directly by the computer, so it will have to be converted to machine language so that the computer understands the order we are trying to transmit to it.

###### Low-level language
Pyton: It has qualities to adapt to any platform or programming paradigm that is presented to it, allowing programmers, regardless of the level of instruction they have, the creation of programs in their interface easily and quickly.

Java: It is simple in its structure and in its use, allowing any type of user to easily program in it and interpret the functions and actions in the programming guidelines in a completely readable way and in natural language.

C ++: Known as the undisputed successor of the C language, it has all the qualities of its predecessor but with new qualities and capabilities that allow it to surpass the C language in multiple factors, such as its ability to be totally focused on the manipulation of objects and on high-level application package programming.

##### - What does a translator do?
There are two types of high-level language translators, compilers and interpreters.

------------
##### - Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code?
COMPILERS
A compiler is a program (software) that, when executed, makes it possible for us to translate (compile) our source code into an object code called also machine code or to an intermediate code called BYTECODE.

INTERPRETER
An interpreter is a program capable of analyzing and executing programs written in high-level languages, interpreters differently from compilers, since they translate and execute the code made by the programmer or developer, line by line, loading the source code and translating the instructions into machine code, so that the program can be executed by the computer where the interpreter is running.

------------
##### - What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?
An interpreter translates high-level instructions into an intermediate form to be executed. In contrast, a compiler translates high-level instructions directly into machine language.

The interpreter translates a program line by line while the compiler translates the entire program and then executes it.

The interpreter detects if the program has errors and allows its debugging during the execution process, while the compiler waits until the compilation of the entire program is finished to generate an error report.

A compiled program is more secure than an interpreted one, because it does not contain the source code, which can be incorrectly modified by the user. 

------------
##### - What is assembly language?
is a low-level programming language used to manipulate the internal instructions of a device. This language can be used in this way mainly because assembly language always offers a one-to-one correspondence between itself and the raw machine code instructions of the device being programmed. This means that each line of assembly language code is perfectly equivalent to an instruction on the device being programmed, so you must neither interpret nor compile for the hardware to “understand”. 

------------
######  A developer is writing a program.
------------

##### - The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code?
A very low-level language requires a human to provide instructions directly to the computer hardware, using the language and structure of that hardware; in the case of high-level languages, humans work with complex and abstract logical tools to write instructions that a given program must translate for the computer to understand. It is generally easier for humans to use these tools.

------------
#####  One type of translator is an interpreter.



##### - Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code?
They differ from compilers or assemblers in that while they translate a program from its description in a programming language into system machine code, interpreters only perform the translation as needed, typically instruction by instruction, and normally they do not save the result of such a translation.
